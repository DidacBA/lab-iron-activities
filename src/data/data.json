    "about": "With this Skip the Line Private Vatican Tour, you will have the time and flexibility you want to experience areas of the Vatican Museums, how long you want to spend in the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica in a way and at a pace that suits you. Having your own personal guide means you will set the agenda for your tour. This Vatican Tour promises to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience!Sites Visited: Vatican Museums, Sistine Chapel, St. Peter's Basilica and St. Peter's Square.Vatican MuseumYour private tour starts with a Skip the Line Access at the Vatican Museum. You are able to pass the general access lines where people often wait for several hours. You will have the chance to explore places such as the Pinecone Courtyard, the Hall of Maps, the Gallery of Tapestries, the Gallery of the Candelabra and the incredible Raphael Rooms. Your guide will bring these halls and works of art to life by telling you stories about the artists behind the masterpieces and pointing out important details you could miss on your own.Sistine ChapelExperience the Sistine Chapel like no one else. You will be able to have an enriching experience with your personal guide. They will point out all the details and give richness to the experience by sharing with you history you may not know. For example, Michelangelo’s boneless self-portrait he painted was to express that he would rather be skinned alive than paint the Sistine Chapel again. As incredible as his work is, it was a backbreaking feat of willpower – a fact you will understand after learning what it takes to create a fresco.St. Peter’s Basilica With Skip the Line access you will go to St. Peter’s Basilica through a VIP entrance. Here you will see the incredible altar and marvel at Michelangelo’s beautiful sculpture, La Pietà, before heading outside for a tour of St. Peter’s Square. Your guided tour finishes here, but you have the option to see and explore more! You can admire Bernini’s clever optical illusion, spot the balcony where the Pope delivers his public addresses and take scenic photographs.",

    "about": "If you want to experience the Sistine Chapel – Michelangelo’s world-famous iconic masterpiece - before the crowds arrive, this tour is definitely for you!With our Skip the Line Access, you’ll avoid the long lines that form before the Vatican Museum doors are even open. In addition, as an Official Vatican Museums Partner, we are allowed into the Sistine Chapel 30 minutes before other tours and an hour and 30 minutes ahead of the general public.You’ll meet your small group of up to 20 people early in the morning and be accompanied to the Sistine Chapel, where you’ll have the time and the space – a full hour before the general public arrives - to contemplate its beauty. This is a far cry from the crowded afternoons when there's barely room to move around in, let alone appreciate, this incredible space.To this day, critics say that no artist’s work has ever approached the scale, technical skill, sense of composition and design of Michelangelo’s frescoes. People the world over have been awestruck by the powerful imagery of the “Creation of Adam,” painted on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, while others have marveled at “The Last Judgment,” which adorns the altar wall. You’ll have the luxury to see these 15th century masterpieces for yourself, up close and personal.After your once-in-a-lifetime Sistine Chapel experience, you have the option to visit the Vatican Museums without having to leave and enter again. Besides full-day tickets, we also provide a map of the 9-mile-long museum and an introduction to its highlights - everything you need to design your own itinerary, enjoying the world-renowned art collections at your own pace.",

Skip the line, early access tickets allow you to see these incredible sites before the majority of the crowds show up.This is an express tour for those who have limited time but don’t want to sacrifice the quality of their experience. By taking you through the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica early in the morning, you will beat the crowds and experience these incredible sites in relative peace.Your tour begins early, entering the Vatican Museums a full half hour before the common public. Before entering the Vatican Museums your guide will hand out visual aids to each guest with a legend for each of the key works of the Sistine Chapel. Using this as a reference point, your guide will brief you on some of the finer points of Michelangelo’s frescoes, and give you some tips on what to look out for. Then it’s into the Sistine Chapel to see for yourself.After 30 minutes admiring the world-famous works of Michelangelo, your group will reconvene at the bottom of the room, where you’ll use a special door to gain direct entry to St. Peter’s Basilica. Only open to tour groups, this skip the line access could save you hours of waiting in the long security lines that form outside the main entrance to the Basilica.We never run this tour with more than 20 people per group but regularly run it with fewer, so that you can always count on plenty of help and information from your expert, English-speaking guide.Sites visited:\n- Sistine Chapel\n- St. Peter’s Basilica",

Visit the Bramante Staircase and the Vatican Gardens, places usually closed to visitors, in a group of no more than 25 people.No trip to Rome is complete without a visit to the Vatican Museums. Made up of fifty-four different galleries, these museums are home to some of the most famous works of art in the world, with artists including Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Raphael and Giotto, to name a few.Our exclusivity is the inclusion of the 1505 Bramante Staircase, a section of the Museums now closed to the general public. Thanks to our partnership with the Vatican we are able to let our customers enjoy this fascinating structure for free, designed to allow people and animals to go up and down without interruption, but, above all, to permit Pope Julius II to enter his private rooms without getting off his carriage. In this corner of the Museums, you'll live special moments of ecstasy admiring quaint views and listening to your guide as they tell you about this unique architecture which inspired numerous copycats.",

    "about": "With the help of our greeter (who will give you all the instructions), board your high-speed train to reach Rome (approx: 1.5 hours). Once arrived in Rome, you can see the highlights of Rome at your own pace as you move into the city to reach the meeting point. You’ll have a hop-on/hop-off all-day pass to get on a comfortable double-decker bus: at Rome Termini Station, go to the closest “hop on - hop off” stop to reach the Vatican tour meeting point (buses depart every 15 min approximately). Thanks to our special Skip-the-Line access, you’ll see all the wonders of the Vatican City, including the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica. Reaching the Vatican Museums, the guide will give you an overview of the history and art of the smallest state in the world. The most famous frescoes in the world will greet you when you enter the jewel box of the Sistine Chapel. Last, but not least, you’ll see the grand cathedral sits atop the very spot where St. Peter was buried. On this self-guided part of the tour, you’ll see the church’s chapels and elaborately painted, multi-domed ceiling; also, Michelangelo’s remarkable Pietà. At the end, hop again on the bus to get back to Termini Station, board your high-speed train and relax while reaching Florence.",

See what cities and countries you can spot in the Hall of the Maps and experience the Museum’s most prized sculpture in the Octagonal Courtyard. We’ll take our time as we explore Raphael's Rooms, which show the master at the height of his powers. Your charismatic guide will enrich your visit with the history and stories behind the art and artists. In intimate groups of just 20 people, you’ll have plenty of interaction with your guide who will be happy to answer any questions you might have.Finally, you’ll experience the Vatican Museum’s highlight, the Sistine Chapel, in the unique atmosphere of the evening.

    "about": "Saving your time and your money, with this “Combo Tour” you will have the opportunity and the security to visit with a professional English local guide the COLOSSEUM, ROMAN FORUMS, PALATINE HILL and VATICAN MUSEUMS WITH SISTINE CHAPEL, without the stress of looking for any ticket and of waiting hours in the long lines. Step 1 Colosseum Tour: You’ll meet your guide near the entrance to The Colosseum the extraordinary amphitheater was ancient Rome’s center of public entertainment. Before you enter, your guide will give you a thorough history lesson about the site, including the gladiatorial lashes and wild-animal fights that were once staged here. Once you’re inside, you’ll wander remnants of the seating arcades that once fit more than 60,000 spectators. Next comes the Roman Forum where you’ll explore the one time cultural, economic, and\npolitical center of ancient Rome. You’ll walk along the Via Sacra, tracing the paths of ancient military processions and political rallies. Next is Palatine Hill: where the twins Romulus and Remus first decided to begin building the city of Rome atop this impressive hill. You’ll understand why as you walk here among its ruined emperors’ palaces and still-blooming botanical gardens. Step 2 Vatican City Tour Itinerary: The Vatican Museums - Reaching the Vatican Museums, the guide will give you an overview of the history and art of the smallest country\nin the World. At the entrance to the Vatican Museums and skipping right past the long entry lines you’ll walk through cavernous galleries filled with ancient sculptures, tapestries, maps, and Etruscan antiquities. The most famous frescoes in the world will greet you when you enter the jewel box of the Sistine Chapel. Here, you’ll be surrounded by the stunning Michelangelo masterpieces that have adorned a million picture postcards including the nine central panels of the chapel ceiling, each depicting a tale from Genesis. Last but not least thanks to a direct passage way from the Sistine chapel you’ll enter the grand basilica- The world’s largest church, and one of its most sacred Catholic sites sit atop the very spot where St. Peter was buried. On this self-guided part of the tour, you’ll see the church’s chapels and elaborately painted, multi-domed ceiling; also, Michelangelo’s remarkable Pietà a sculptural depiction of the Virgin Mary cradling her son.",

    "about": "End your day in Rome at the Vatican Museums by night with an amazing tour and an exclusive dinner in a beguiling location. Vatican City may be the smallest country on Earth, but with nine miles of invaluable artwork kept in more than 2,000 rooms visiting it can be overwhelming, especially during the day.If in Rome for a long resting weekend, or even after a busy day at work topping your hard-working week, just indulge in a tour of one of the most important museums in the world led by a professional guide on Friday nights. The tour starts with a special dinner in an exclusive location inside the Vatican City: you will have to pinch yourself when a tour assistant will take you to the so-called Giardino Quadrato for your outdoor meal overlooking St. Peter's Dome.After dinner, you will be led into the Vatican Museums, one of the most important places in the history of human civilization. Get to know the important collections of art the various popes have acquired throughout the centuries. Look out for renowned sculptures and masterpieces of Renaissance art. Feel the weight of history and get a sense of the sacred as you spy paintings by Raphael, Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio and Michelangelo, including his masterwork: the Sistine Chapel.Thanks to the special agreement as Tour Operator Partners of the Vatican Museums you will skip all lines, saving long waits that usually form outside this popular attraction.",

    "about": "Enter the Sistine Chapel before it opens to the general public and enjoy Michelangelo’s masterpieces in peace, before embarking on a thorough guided tour of the Vatican Museums and St. Peter’s Basilica.There is simply no better way to see the highlights of the Vatican without the crowds that can overrun the galleries later in the day. The Sistine Chapel wasn’t meant to be seen standing shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other people. Beat the crowds by entering 45 minutes before the Chapel opens to the public.After spending quality time with Michelangelo’s frescoes in the Chapel, your guide will lead you on a full tour of the Vatican Museums, stopping to see all the most important works. Since you have started early, you’ll stay one step ahead of the crowds in most galleries as you enjoy fantastic art like the Raphael Rooms, the Apollo Belvedere, Laocoon and Sons, and more.When you’ve covered the Museums, you’ll enter the Sistine Chapel again, much more crowded now, and pass through a special corridor that lets you skip the lines into St. Peter’s Basilica. Here, you’ll enjoy an hour-long tour of the immense Basilica, including stops at Michelangelo’s heart-wrenching Pietá and Bernini’s enormous Baldachin altar. Afterwards, you'll be free to explore the St. Peter’s for as long as you want.",

At the entrance to the Vatican Museums skip the line and walk through cavernous galleries filled with ancient sculptures, tapestries, maps, and Etruscan antiquities. The most famous frescoes in the world will greet you when you enter the jewel box of the Sistine Chapel. Here, you’ll be surrounded by the stunning Michelangelo masterpieces that have adorned a million picture postcards including the nine central panels of the chapel ceiling, each depicting a tale from Genesis (the most famous being The Creation of Adam). Last, but not least, thanks to a direct passageway, you’ll see the grand Basilica. The world’s largest church, and one of its most sacred Catholic sites sits atop the very spot where St. Peter was buried. On this self-guided part of the tour, you’ll see the church’s chapels and elaborately painted, multi-domed ceilings as well as Michelangelo’s remarkable Pietà, a sculptural depiction of the Virgin Mary cradling her son.",

Once past security, your representative will provide you with a City Wonders map to help you find your way around the Museum and navigate the works of the Sistine Chapel. And as simple as that, you are now free to explore the Vatican Museums on your own!For you access to the Colosseum, your representative will escort you inside, helping you skip the line and exchanging your voucher for an actual ticket. You’ll be able to experience the immensity of ancient Rome’s most iconic symbol at your own pace, enjoying privileged direct access to the Arena Floor through the recently opened ‘Gladiator’s Entrance’, without the lines and long security checks.Feel the glory and majesty of Rome at the height of its power as you walk on the very same stones as those who came to fight here in gladiatorial combat, treading in their footsteps out onto a partial reconstruction of the arena floor, looking up at the tiered ruins that were once filled with some 50,000-80,000 bloodthirsty spectators.You are sure to hear their echoes as your eyes are drawn upward, your body turns and your mind is boggled by the elegance and engineering prowess of what was once the largest structure of its kind in the world, all from this unique 360° view, home to the gladiatorial games, exotic staged hunts, theatrical executions and even mock sea-battles.Enjoy up-close views of the underground area where the spectacle was brought to life, and the panorama from where the Emperor’s box once stood, all special access areas that standard ticket holders don’t get to see. In addition, you’ll gain access to the second floor, tracing the Colosseum’s circumference in an effort to understand what it must have been like when the stands were packed, the crowds were roaring and a gladiator’s destiny hung on their whims.After the tour you’ll also have the option of staying inside the Colosseum to continue your exploration or follow our representative to take advantage of the skip-the-line access to the Roman Forum. You’ll also be able to hike to the top of the Palatine Hill for an exceptional bird’s-eye perspective over the Forum and Circus Maximus.",

    "about": "The Semi-Private Vatican Tour will give you a perfect chance to fully enjoy one of the most important museums in the world, the Vatican Museums and see the Sistine Chapel with a professional tour guide in a small group of a maximum of 13 people.\nWith more than 1400 galleries and 6 million visitors per year, the Vatican Museums is usually extremely busy and crowded, especially during the high season when they may receive more than 30,000 visitors per day. This fantastic tour is designed for you to discover the Vatican’s beautiful art in a quieter and more focused way.\nOur tour guides are accredited by the Vatican and each possesses many years of experience. They are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about their work and they will tell you all about the fascinating history of the smallest country in the world. Let them reveal to you its secrets and the mysteries of its past.\nHeadsets will allow you to clearly hear your guide, even from a distance, giving you time to take pictures and have a longer look at your favorite pieces of art.\nSee the highlights of the museums, the amazing galleries such as the Gallery of the Candelabra, where you can admire the rich collection of Roman sculptures, the Gallery of Tapestries and the Gallery of Maps, along with many other art treasures, sculptures, paintings and beautiful architecture.\nFinally, enjoy Michelangelo’s remarkable Sistine Chapel in its entirety. After the tour, we will bring you into St. Peter’s Basilica through a special entrance, reserved exclusively for official guides and their groups.\nBy joining our Semi-Private Vatican Tour, you will skip both lines for the Vatican Museums and Saint Peter’s Basilica, thus avoiding a waste of your valuable time.",
    "meeting_point": "This tour starts from our office. Please be aware to not miss the entrance of our office: Look out for a street sign with our red circled logo and the white words \"Maya Tours\" on it Our Office is located near the entrance of the Vatican Museums (approx. a 5-minute walk). If you are taking public transport, we suggest you take the Metro (A-line) and get off at \"Ottaviano\". Once outside the station, head south on Via Ottaviano towards St. Peter's square then turn right onto Via Germanico (second street on your right). We are on the right-hand side at number 16. The street is easy to reach by Taxi as well. If you are new in town we recommend you look up our location on google maps before as Rome's streets might seem a bit confusing in the beginning. If you have any trouble finding us for whatever reason, please don't hesitate to contact us!",

    "description": "Buy your VIP Vatican tour on Musement today! Exclusive breakfast experience in the Pinecone Courtyard and Vatican Museums guided visit with early access.",
    "about": "Have the Vatican to yourself on this exclusive, one of a kind early morning tour that opens closed doors for a buffet breakfast in the peaceful Pinecone Courtyard – before anyone else enters the Museums! A true exclusive privilege.While the general public waits outside, you'll feast on an Italian-American buffet of pastries, meats, cheeses, hot food and pancakes made on the spot. In the beautiful Pinecone Courtyard, you'll experience a level of tranquility rarely seen by visitors to the Vatican. This is the Vatican Palaces as they were made to be seen – without the crowds.After breakfast you'll follow your tour guide into the Vatican Museums. Only just opened to other tour groups at this stage (still closed to the public), the Museums will be quieter than they are throughout the rest of the day – and with only 17 people max per group, you'll have time and space to appreciate the art.On your guided tour, your expert, English-speaking guide will show you all the best of the Vatican collection. You'll see ancient cartography in the Gallery of the Maps, visual illusions in the Gallery of the Tapestries and marvel at the Raphael Rooms. Raphael’s frescoes are said by many to rival the beauty of the Sistine Chapel. Of course, we won’t forget that highlight, as we visit Michelangelo’s world-famous ‘Last Judgment’ and ‘The Creation of Adam’ in the Sistine Chapel.With Skip the Line Access you won't have to wait before the next leg of our Vatican adventure. Your guide will lead you through a separate entrance to St. Peter’s Basilica where they’ll give a guided tour of Michelangelo's Pieta and the incredible altar among other works in the world’s largest historic Basilica.This tour is the first time in history that the Vatican Museums has allowed members of the public to enter so early – not to mention with a buffet breakfast – and City Wonders Tours is the only tour operator to offer it. Add to this early Museums access, small group sizes and a dedicated tour guide and you have easily the most relaxing way to see the Vatican Museums.",

    "about": "Your tour starts in the middle of it all, as your friendly guide will be waiting for you right outside the Metro Stop Colosseo. Yep, you guessed right, first stop: The magnificent Colosseum! That’s just the beginning of the journey which that you will see walking through the Forum to the Piazza Venezia and the controversial Vittorian. Making your way through the streets of Rome, you’ll emerge at the top of the Spanish Steps to one of the best views of the Eternal City. The sights only get more iconic from here; next up is the Trevi Fountain, where your guide will teach you how to throw your coin over your shoulder (or maybe two?); Piazza Navona where you’ll learn all about Bernini, Rome’s version of Michelangelo; and the Pantheon, which for many visitors is the most incredible spot in the entire city.After a short break at one of Rome’s best and oldest gelaterias, Make our way to the Castelo di Sant'Angelo. There, looming in the distance, you’ll see the mother of all churches: Saint Peter’s Basilica, the biggest church in the world within the smallest country in the world.From here the tour will end, or you can select the optional Vatican Museums tour to continue with your guide inside! Begin your tour of the Vatican Museums with a fully-licensed guide, who will teach you all the legends, history and curiosities of this enigmatic place. Best of all: you’ll skip-the-line, giving you maximum time in the museum!",

    "about": "Early access to the Sistine Chapel is perfect for those who want to see this masterpiece without the crowds. By gaining access before other tour groups and the general public, you will be sure to experience it as it was meant to be. After your quiet Sistine Chapel visit you can choose to enter the Vatican Museums, wandering the Papal Palace on your own, seeing all there is to see on your own time and at your own pace. If time is short, you can fly on to the next sight on your list, content in the knowledge that you have seen Rome’s finest masterpiece.Our Early Access Sistine Chapel group meets before the Vatican Museums open, skipping the long lines already outside and entering before anyone else. Visitors will be accompanied to the Sistine Chapel where they’ll be the first to enter, finding this incredible hall empty. Later in the day there will barely be room to move, but in the minutes before opening time, all is quiet.After the Sistine Chapel, visitors can wander the Vatican Museums for the rest of the day free of charge – and with such an early meeting time, the day ahead is long. Your escort will leave you with a map and an introduction to the most important areas of the museums so you can get the most from your time with the Vatican’s nine-mile art collection.City Wonders is currently the only tour operator to offer this special access, getting visitors into the Vatican Museums at 07.45am, 15 minutes ahead of other tour operators and 1 hour and 15 minutes before the general public. With no more than 20 people per group and a maximum of two City Wonders groups running per day, your Sistine experience will be as intimate as it should be.",

Admire the beautiful Vatican Museums, Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica, feast your eyes on the artworks of old masters like Michelangelo and Raphael, and explore the Pio Clementine Museum, Belvedere Courtyard and more.Start your tour heading to the Vatican Museums and let your guide bring the works of art to life at the Pinecone Courtyard, the Hall of Maps, the Gallery of Tapestries, and the Gallery of Candelabra. You'll learn about the figures responsible for these works and their history along the way.\nLater, visit the magnificent Sistine Chapel. Take some time inside the world-famous room to pick out the details you hear about – Michelangelo’s self-portrait, for example, in which he expresses to the world that he would rather be skinned alive than paint in the Sistine Chapel again. As incredible as his work is, it must have been back-breaking – a fact you’ll understand all the better after you learn what it takes to create a fresco.\nAfter the Sistine Chapel, enjoy No Wait Access yet again, exiting through a special door that leads straight into St. Peter’s Basilica, where you will enjoy on your own the holiest place in Christendom. See the incredible altar and marvel at Michelangelo’s beautiful sculpture, La Pietà, before heading outside to St. Peter’s Square.",

Thanks to our special Skip-the-Line access you’ll see all the wonders of the Vatican City, including the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica, without waiting to enter; you’ll also get a thrilling, in-depth exploration of the iconic Colosseum and other sites of ancient Rome. On each group tour, you’ll be accompanied by an English-speaking expert in Roman art and history. Reaching the Vatican Museums, the guide will give you an overview of the history and art of the smallest state in the World. At the entrance to the Vatican Museums—and skipping right past the long entry lines—you’ll walk through cavernous galleries filled with ancient sculptures, tapestries, maps, and Etruscan antiquities. The most famous frescoes in the world will greet you when you enter the jewel box of the Sistine Chapel. Last but not least, you’ll see the grand cathedral sits atop the very spot where St. Peter was buried. On this self-guided part of the tour, you’ll see the church’s chapels and elaborately painted, multi-domed ceiling; also, Michelangelo’s remarkable Pietà. At the end, board again on your high speed train and relax while reaching Florence after your journey through the History of Rome.",

    "meeting_point": "This tour starts from our office. Please be aware to not miss the entrance of our office: Look out for a street sign with our red circled logo and the white words \"Maya Tours\" on it Our Office is located near the entrance of the Vatican Museums (approx. a 5 minute walk). If you are taking public transport, we suggest you take the Metro (A-line) and get off at \"Ottaviano\". Once outside the station, head south on Via Ottaviano towards St. Peter's square then turn right onto Via Germanico (second street on your right). We are on the right-hand side at number 16. The street is easy to reach by Taxi as well. If you are new in town we recommend you to look up our location on google maps before as Rome's streets might seem a bit confusing in the beginning. If you have any trouble finding us for whatever reason please don't hesitate to contact us!",

During this short waiting time, your guide will explain the Vatican history and architecture.You will have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enter one of the restricted areas of the Museums, the \"Cabinet of Masks\", whose name originates from the main subject of the mosaics that adorn the gallery floors. These beautiful, precious mosaics once adorned a Roman Villa; later, they were hosted in the beautiful Hadrian’s Villa in Tivoli.Then, you will admire the stunning Sistine Chapel, with the amazing frescoes skillfully made by Michelangelo, representing various scenes from the Last Judgment chapter of the Bible. Entering before the general opening will mean you can appreciate this masterpiece without being rushed, benefitting from the detailed explanation of your guide. The last stop of your tour will be inside St. Peter's Basilica: you will skip the line, entering the Cathedral from a small passage from the Sistine Chapel and you will admire the beautiful marble sculpture by Michelangelo, the world-famous \"Pietà\".",
